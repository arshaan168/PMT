# PMT Project Management Platform

A modern, full-stack project management application built with MERN stack.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB
- Git

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the server directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the client directory:
   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The frontend will run on `http://localhost:5173`

## 🔧 Configuration

### Backend Connection
The frontend is configured to connect to the backend at `http://localhost:5000/api` by default. If your backend runs on a different port or URL, you can:

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the client directory
2. Add the following line:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL=http://your-backend-url/api
   ```

### Environment Variables
- `VITE_API_URL`: Backend API URL (default: http://localhost:5000/api)
- `VITE_SOCKET_URL`: Socket.IO URL for real-time features (default: http://localhost:5000)
